 > Today I lerned -   
 - Importance of Markdown language.  
 - Documentation in Markdown Language.  
 - Use of documentation in Making resume. 
 - Brif introduction about cloud computing.  
 
## 1.Importance of Markdown language.

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats.The Markdown editor helps you to perform basic editing capabilities: manage headings, apply formatting to text to make it bold or italic, and so on.
  
- Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML or HTML.
  
## 2. Documentation in Markdown Language.

- Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
 
 ## 4. Use of documentation  in Making resume.

- Resumme generally based on Kaywords.Speaker gave some short introduction about use of such type of documentation in *resume*.
- Markdown is designed to be human-readable, so if you need a raw text version of your resume, no transformation is needed.
  Markdown has syntax for section headers, lists, tables and more, so you can add as much structure as you want to your resume.

 ## 3.introduction about cloud computing.
 
 > Speaker explained by understandable example.
 - cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet  to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. 
 
 - **Cloud Computing** is the use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network . Cloud computing uses remote resources, saving organizations the cost of servers and other equipment.
 
 - Speaker tought us why we use cloud computing, by giving examples like Data Science, IOT,Robotics etc. also how we merge cloud computing with our field.
 

 ### Benefits of cloud computing :
 
-  Cost Savings
- Security
- Flexibility
- Mobility
- Insight
- Increased Collaboration
- Quality Control
- Disaster Recovery
- Loss Prevention
- Automatic Software Updates
- Competitive Edge
- Sustainability

  # Cloud Computing is all about infrastructure #

  > # ***What is Vertual Machine and working of virtual machine***
  
  -  A virtual machine is a program on a computer that works like it is a separate computer inside the main computer. The program that controls virtual machines is called a  **hypervisor** and the computer that is running the virtual machine is called the host. The hypervisor controls how the virtual machine can access memory, hard drive space, and other resources on the host computer. Virtual machines can be created through software known as **virtualization software.**
  
 ### Reasons to run a virtual machine:
 
 - It is a simple way to run more than one operating system on the same computer.
 - A very powerful server can be split into several smaller virtual machines to use its resources better.
 - It can help with security. If the virtual machine is affected by a virus, the host operating system is unaffected.
 - A virtual machine can be completely emulated, such as Java. This lets a program run on different types of computer without having to    be converted into a code specific for it. They can communicate even though the programming languages are not the same.

>  # ***Types of Cloud Survices:***
 
 ## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
 
   - Infrastructure as a Service is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you the most control over the provided      hardware that runs your application , storage, and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an      instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.
   
 ## Platform as a service (PaaS)
 
   - PaaS provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an      application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure. For example, when deploying a web application using PaaS, you        don't have to install an operating system, web server, or even system updates.
 ## Software as a service (SaaS)
 
  - SaaS is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually based on an architecture where one version     of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. Office 365, Skype, and Dynamics     CRM Online are perfect examples of SaaS software.

  > # ***SDD and SSD ***
  
# Solid-State Drive (SSD) 

- Solid-State Drive (SSD) or Solid-State Disk (SSD), is a storage device that stores data on non-volatile memory. Solid-State means storage that doesnâ€™t require moving parts. Unlike Hard Disk Drive (HDD), there are no moving parts to an SSD. Some advantages of SSD are faster access time, noiseless operation and low-er power consumption.
  
# software design description (SDD)

- IEEE 1016-1998, also known as the Recommended Practice for Software Design Descriptions, is an IEEE standard that specifies an organizational structure for a software design description (SDD). An SDD is a document used to specify system architecture and application design in a software related project.

> # ***Capital expenditure (CapEx) versus operational expenditure (OpEx)***

## Capital Expenditure (CapEx) :-##

 -### CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.
 
 ## Operational Expenditure (OpEx):-##
 
 - ### OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There's no upfront cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it.
